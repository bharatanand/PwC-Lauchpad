   Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, open-source, high-level programming
   language with dynamic semantics.The simple syntax, and versatility, 
   along with its beginner-friendliness, have made it one of the most-used programming languages today. 
   In this course, you will learn the basic concepts of Python programming.  
   This course will cover data types, variables, expressions, conditional and iterative statements, 
   and functions, which are foundational concepts in computer programming. 
   This course will also teach you how to use and create custom Python modules, 
   which enable you to benefit from the 
   vast array of functionality that is already a part of the Python language.
