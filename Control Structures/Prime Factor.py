# Objective:
# To work with looping statements

# Scenario:
# If a factor of a number is a prime number, then it is its prime factor.  
# You must only consider positive integers for finding prime factors. Write a python program to find the prime factor(s) of any given number. 

# Note:  
# If the number specified is lesser than or equal to zero, display "Invalid Input!!" and stop the program execution. 
# If the number specified is a prime number itself, display "Invalid Input!! Prime number inputs are not allowed" 
# and stop the program execution.
